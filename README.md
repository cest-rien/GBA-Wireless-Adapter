# GBA-Wireless-Adapter
"G-BAWA" is a publically cataloged attempt to reverse engineer the GBA wireless adapter and firmware to recreate functionality on an internal chip set through basic modding techniques.

 
 
**Background**

I started this project when evaluating homebrew and modding methods that are already popular in the retro community, particularly after discovering the increase of mod retailers like retromodding and handheldlegend selling votage regulators to compensate for multimod gba systems.
