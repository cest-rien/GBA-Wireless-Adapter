# GBA-Wireless-Adapter
"G-BAWA" is a publically cataloged attempt to reverse engineer the GBA wireless adapter and firmware to recreate functionality on an internal chip set through basic modding techniques.

I started this project when evaluating homebrew and modding methods that are already popular in the retro community, particularly after discovering the increase of mod retailers like retromodding and handheldlegend selling votage regulators to compensate for multimod gba systems.

My intended goal with this project is to reverse engineer the original WA so that a custom pcb can be added internally to the gba shell with functionality to avoid both the powerdrain and port blocking casued by using the original adapter. Since the modding community had increased greatly since 2019/2020, the rise of custom chip mods for many retro handhels has increased dramatically for power adapters, various i/o modding, HDMI adapter, [Tindie's wireless custom cart](https://www.tindie.com/products/insidegadgets/wireless-gameboy-controller-device/), and a ridiculous number of others. Including [that psychopath](https://there.oughta.be/an/about/page) who somehow found a way to use [an **original** gameboy and modded cart to access wikipedia.](https://there.oughta.be/)
